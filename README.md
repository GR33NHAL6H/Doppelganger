# Doppelganger - 2018

Doppelganger is a lightweight node that automatically finds and connects to the node of your choice. This can be anything from a read node to a camera or lens distortion node. It saves you having to copy and paste the same node over and over causing scripts to increase in size and increasing user error when manually updating versions.

## User Settings
- Refresh will look for nodes in the script that have a hidden code in, so it requires you to use the DoppelgangerSetup.nk as the start point
- Connect will connect to the selected node you want
- Find will locate the node the Doppelganger is attached to
- Connect all Doppelgangers will look through your script and connect any that have been disconnected to their chosen node. This is useful for when copying entire scripts
